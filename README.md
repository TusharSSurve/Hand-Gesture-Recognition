Hand Gesture Recognition with OpenCV &amp; MediaPipe

Hand Gesture Recognition can be done with the help of finding Angle between the landmarks or by finding the co-ordinates between the landmarks. The main disadvantage of using angle is you need to do lots of manual work which can easily be done with the help of coordinates.
